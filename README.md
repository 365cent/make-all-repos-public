# Make all repos on github to public

The main.go is simple script written in golang to make visibility of all the repos on your Github account to public.

## Usage
Replace `<github username>` with your own GitHub username
Replace `<github personal access token>` with your own Personal access tokens (classic), which you can generate by visiting [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
Run `go run main.go`
You are all done, the script should output all the repository that it sets to public.
